# TODO: Footer Standardization Fix

## Task: Standardize Footer Across All Pages

### Issue Found

- pages/contact.html had INCORRECT footer services list (8 items instead of 7)
- Combined "Biological & Clinical Sample Logistics" instead of separate items
- Added "Supply Chain Consulting" which doesn't exist on other pages

### Master Footer (7 items - standardized across all pages)

1. Cold-Chain Support
2. Biological Sample Shipments
3. Clinical Sample Logistics
4. Freight Transportation
5. Warehousing
6. Distribution
7. Cross-Border Logistics

### Files Edited

- [x] pages/contact.html - Fixed footer services list

- [x] index.html - Already had correct 7-item list
- [x] pages/services.html - Already had correct 7-item list  
- [x] pages/team.html - Already had correct 7-item list

### Verification Complete

- [x] No combined "Biological & Clinical Sample Logistics" in any footer
- [x] Brand name preserved as "Express It Logistics Ltd"
